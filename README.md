📅 Day 1 – Voice Agent Foundations
🎯 Goal

Build my first real-time voice AI agent and understand how voice agents differ from chatbots.

🧠 What I Built

A basic voice-enabled AI agent

Real-time speech-to-text → LLM → text-to-speech loop

Connected frontend UI with backend agent logic

🧩 Key Concepts Learned

Voice agents are event-driven, not request-response

Turn detection is critical for natural conversations

Audio pipelines behave very differently from text APIs

🛠 Tech Used

LiveKit Agents

Murf Falcon (TTS)

Python backend

React frontend

🧠 Takeaway

This day completely changed how I think about AI apps.
Unlike MERN APIs, voice agents feel alive — they listen, interrupt, and respond in real time
